A collection of small projects made using Racket's ISL

Graphing Calculator: Simple graphing calculator with zooming and panning that allows one to visualize any non-implicit function.

Prime Numbers: Easy program to calculate next prime number. Use (main \<number\>) to run the program, and press space to calculate next prime number. Numbers above 10^16 take much longer to process.
